Roundabouts are great if you don’t like waiting for traffic lights; the downside is that there tend to be more accidents. We can describe this more precisely with a “danger number”: given a car journey, its danger number is the number of places where the car must merge with oncoming traffic. For example, in the diagram below, the danger number would be 2 for the blue car, since it enters road 1 and drives past road 2. Note that it does not merge at road 3. Similarly, the red car doing a U-turn has a danger number of 5.
